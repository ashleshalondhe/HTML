    <!--HTML Elements
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
    
Examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>


    Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). 
    These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!


    Nested HTML Elements

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.

The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>)-->

    <!--If you want to know all the elements you can get it from geeksofgeeks, w3 school, 
    javatpoint, etc all the ements are available on internet-->
